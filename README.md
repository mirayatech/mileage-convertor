## 🚴 Cycle Mile Converter

A tool that asks you how far you've cycled in kilometers and tells you how far that is in miles.

## 💭 What I Learned

- **Printing on Screen** (`print()`): Now I can make any text show up on the screen with `print()`.
- **Getting Answers** (`input()`): I use `input()` to ask users for information and wait for their reply.
- **Combining Words and Answers** (strings and variables): I learned to create messages by combining text and user responses.

- **Different Kinds of Information** (data types): I understand how to work with many data types like integers, floats, and strings.
- **Math in Python** (operators): Using operators, I can easily convert kilometers to miles.
- **Making Text Look Nice** (f-strings): With f-strings, I can make the text look neat and tidy, with numbers slotted into sentences perfectly.

## 👟 How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. When it asks, type how many kilometers you cycled.
3. It tells you how many miles that is.

## 🐛 Bug
